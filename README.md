- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdglassman310
- 👀 The motivation for my work is to build us towards a Star Trek future. It sounds silly but you'd understand after a few minutes of conversation with me.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my capabilities to lead large-scale projects that combine software development and subject matter expertise into an integrated product delivery scheme.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use civil engineering and reliability engineering to enhance our interaction with the built and natural environment.
